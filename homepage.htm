           	This is the homepage of learning basic guitar by Charlie Le. Once day I was so boring that I decided to create some thing telling all my experiences about guitar learning as well as my summary in learning guitar. </p>
           <p>
           	I would recommend that you should take a glance on my introduction page that I have covered all my knowledge as well as my recommendation about the guitar.
           	</p>
           	<p>
           	In the second step, after reading all of my bibliography and all my experience about learning guitar and realize that music is a part of our life that can not replacable. You should hit the chord button and learn couple basic and useful guitar chord that crucial for playing really basic rhythm guitar and you can sing after that. In my perspective and experience, I begin with learning some basic chord first, then I began to play some songs and sang after that. Then, I felt in love with guitar. Then, I have known about the fingerstyle or you can do actually much more interesting stuff on the guitar, not only playing rhythm. 
           	</p>
           <p>
           	After knowing a little bit of chord you should hit the tab button to know what is the tab actually doing and functioning in playing fingerstyle. You can learn and watch some videos of famous guitarist in the world that I am really look up to and they are the perfect guy who you want to copy all of their playing style. In this site, you also get access to a "thesaurus" of tabs of my favourite songs from a lot of famous composer that can played wonderfully on guitar.
