	Chord
</h1>
<h3>
	Learning guitar with chord initially would be the best choice for the beginners who want to begin and take an initial with. 
</h3>
<br />  Especially, once players start playing guitar with chords, they can access to the society of guitarist and play what ever songs they want because playing rhythm song would be the best way to play guitar.
 <h2>
 	Some basic chords that every guitarist would never obliviate and consider that would be the first milestone to become outstanding player. 
 </h2>
          <strong>
          	There are lots of players that succeed on playing guitar without learning all the music theories that are really hard to understand and remember. Because of that difficulties, there is an major in every university in the world that just learning all the music theories for the last 4 years.</strong><br />
          	Therefore, the only and major ways that every beginner chose to begin with playing guitar is learning chords, how is it function and what is the rule between chords and how guitarists change the chord skillfully. 
          	<ol>
          		<li>
          			What is chords ?
          		</li>
          	</ol>
          	- A chord is the combination of three or more notes
          	- Chords are built off of a single note, called the root.
          	<em> For example, the C major chord is the combination of  the note C, E, G together. Moreover, E major is the combination of note E, G and B together. Personally, I enjoy play in the E scale basically my voice is in tone E and the sound of E major is kind of really mystery.</em>
          	<ol>
          		<li>
          			What is GAM?
          		</li>
          	</ol>
        	- There is 7 notes in 1 GAM:<strong> A B C D E F G  </strong>. 
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			What is the relationship between chord and GAM ?
        		</li>
        	</ol>
        	- There is a GAM system for each chord specifically ( there is exactly 7 major chord : A major, B major, C major, D major, E major, F major, G major )
        	-A song which played in C major just only use the chord in the GAM of C major ( there is some special case that appear some weird kind of chord that does not follow any rule in the music theory)
        	<i>
        		For example C major GAM has some of following chords:
        	<br /> C-E-G
        	<br /> D-F-A
        	<br /> E-G-B
        	<br /> F-A-C
        	<br /> A-C-E
        	<br /> B-D-F<br />
        	- 3 main chords that I usually play with:
        	<br /> G Major
        	<br /> C Major
        	<br /> D Major<br />
        	</i><br><br><br>
        	<img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72ewXxDNdtM/VuLb7ymz6RI/AAAAAAAABRc/QgAu_t9z7_wD0M6_VxjLaswuhGPlTuwcw/s1600/4_hop_am_thanh_thanh_co_ban.PNG"><br /><br /><br />4 basic chords that every newbie should begin with</a>
        	<br> From the left to the right respectively:  A minor, F, C, G.
        	<p>NOTE:Number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 indicate the order of your fingers in your hand </p>
        	<strong><i>Number 1 indicate your index finger<br>Number 2 indicate your middle finger<br>Number 3 indicate your ring finger <br>and lastly number 4 is indicatte little finger</i></strong>
        	<p>The reason why they put in number into the picture is they want you to play chord in the most easy way you can so that when you change your fingers between different chords, you are able to change it more easily.</p>
        	<p>If you are fine with those four basic chords above, you can extend your level by learning more intermediate chords</p>
        	<p>We have 7 notes, each note have to main chords : Major and Minor , which means you can play most of the songs nowaday just by learning all of the 14 major chords</p>
        	<p>Then, if you want to reach to expert level, you should learn some of the 5, 7, 9 chords, which means each of the 14 chords can play in more 3 different ways, the advantage of learning how to play those 5, 7, 9 chords is you can play more flexible and it sounds more similar to the songs that originally write in 5, 7, 9 chords but played in basic chords.</p>
