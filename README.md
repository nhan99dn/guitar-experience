# hello-world
This is the first repository  of Charlie aka Nhan
My name is Charlie , that is my American name, my original name is Le Thanh Nhan , I come from Vietnam , just been to US for 2 months for studying abroad 
I dreamt to have a job that can go to work wherever i want , not being controlled passively to stand in one damn place in hole year doing work , so i decided to be a web developer , which is really interesting and mystery
Yet, I am learning the basics stuff about the CSS HTML or JS , so I could say that I am not know anything about the web developing tho .
I hope that this GitHub can help me to find many amazing dudes that collaborate and help me to push level up
