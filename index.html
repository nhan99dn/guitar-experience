   </center>
	<p>Chord is the composition and collaboration of notes to make a melody of a song.</p><br />
	<p>Depends on the writer and composer, a song can includes dozen of different chord. However, a song can include only 1 chord to play the entire melody.</p><hr />

    <h1 style="font-family:courier;">Notes</h1>
		</center><hr />
		<p>Most of the people who like to play guitar begin with learning notes and theory of music, which is quite boring but really promising and good for the future, because there is a level that do not require you to sharpen your skill on guitar but you have to understand why and how the music is going happen, and when you get comfort with that, you are ready for many new levels and stuff that really interesting.</p>
		<p>To my knowledge, studying and learning the theory of music is the best way for the beginers to learn guitar, but it is not the only one for you to take initial with, but I guarantee for you guys that those are the good way to learning guitar</p><hr />
		<p><strong>This is a hardest and most challenging part of learning how to play guitar because start to learning everything is always hard and you have to get comfort with it. Remember that every successful person begin to start with a basic things and they are people that failed a lot. So do not frustrated when you find something hard to learn, begin with small step and take time with that. As long as you comfortable and love that, you will do it unconditionally and you will love this instrument like I do : <em>"They can do it, why we are not?"</em></strong></p>

	<h1 style="font-family:courier;">Sharing about my history of learning guitar:</h1>
		</center>
		<h2 style="font-family:Arial;">Not profesional</h2>
			<p>Is the word that describe the time I have learned guitar. Count to now, I have learned guitar for 3.5 years <br />(remember that it does not matter that how long have you learned this instrument, it does matter that how many hours that you have spent on learning it and if it is continuous or it is not). For example, 2 people have learned guitar for 1 year. The guy who spent 1 hour every to study it will get familiar with guitar faster than the guy that spent half a hour per day and uncontinuously.</p>
		<h2 style="font-family:Arial;">Uncontinuously</h2>
			<p>There is a time that I felt in love with watching anime, trust me , I spent about 8 hours a day for just sitting one damn spot and watching anime. As a result, I drop out playing guitar for 1 month. Moreover, learning in a gifted school (my major is Maths) is so crazy, I do not even have time to entertain myself after school, I have to spend most of my time in extra classes. So I would say that my learning guitar is uncontinuous.</p>
		<h2 style="font-family:Arial;">My burning passion.</h2>
			<p>If I to evaluate myself, I would say that I am an emotional person, I enjoy tackle problems myself, I am extremely introverted, I am really hard to make friend with because I feel that people does not like me a lot though I am really friendly. I have a high EQ scores which means I cry whenever I watch a romantic movies or animes. I never and ever complain about stuffs happen around my life and I always do it by myself. So I consider my guitar as my best, life friend, without it , I can not whisper to myself, I can not be myself when I am alone, I can not share my feeling to others.</p>
		<h2 style="font-family:Arial;">Special bonus</h2>
			<p>This is my video covering the song named Hana ( means flower in English ) by guitarist Masaaki Kisibe:</p>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/YgXA2KiNmjs"><br /><img src="http://www.charlestonspiritual.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/click-to-play-front-slider-940x410.jpg" title="Ảnh Ngầu Lòi Của Lee Chan Jin" width="999px" height="300px" /></a><br />
		<p>To be honest, I tired shit by recording this video. Because I did not have any experience on recording a music videos, so I did record for about 50 times till found the least failure in my cover. I spent about 2 hours to record a song last for 4 minutes lol.</p>
